 * CI regression config for the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` job.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND CONFIG EXISTS
 * --------------------------
 * The shared workflow (ConductionNL/.github/.github/workflows/quality.yml)
 * runs the suite as:
 *
 *     CONFIG="${{ inputs.playwright-test-path }}/playwright.config.ts"
 *     if [ ! -f "$CONFIG" ] && [ -f "playwright.config.ts" ]; then
 *       CONFIG="playwright.config.ts"
 *     fi
 *     npx playwright test --config="$CONFIG"
 *
 * Note what is missing: `--project`. So whichever config it picks, EVERY
 * project in it runs. The root `playwright.config.ts` declares three:
 *
 *   chromium     — the regression suite. This is the one CI wants.
 *   docs-capture — journeydoc screenshot capture (ADR-030). Re-shoots every
 *                  tutorial screenshot; it is opt-in by design and has its own
 *                  invocation (`--project docs-capture`).
 *   visual       — pixel-diff baselines. Its own header says the PNGs are
 *                  host-font/GPU specific and "a CI Linux runner will not
 *                  byte-match a dev-container baseline".
 *
 * Letting the root config be picked would therefore run two projects that are
 * documented as unable to pass on a CI runner, on top of the one that can.
 * Rather than delete or weaken them, `playwright-test-path: tests/e2e` in the
 * caller makes the workflow's FIRST lookup hit this file, which declares only
 * the regression project. The root config is untouched and stays the entry
 * point for local runs and for `--project docs-capture` / `--project visual`.
 *
 * The report/output paths also differ deliberately: the workflow uploads
 * `server/apps/<app>/playwright-report/` and `server/apps/<app>/test-results/`,
 * so on CI the artifacts must land at the APP ROOT, not under `tests/e2e/`.
 * With the root config's paths the "Upload Playwright report" step matches
 * nothing and silently uploads an empty artifact (`if-no-files-found: ignore`)
 * — a failing run with no report to read.
 *
 * Timeouts are deliberately higher than the root config's 30s/10s. The shared
 * workflow serves Nextcloud from `php -S` on a 2-core runner, which is slower
 * than the dev container the root config is tuned for; the individual specs
 * still pass their own explicit per-assertion timeouts, so this only sets the
 * ceiling for assertions that declare none.
