 * Whether this e2e run is allowed to touch the instance it is aimed at.
 *
 * GENERATED FROM hydra/templates/e2e/shared-instance.ts.tmpl. The only thing
 * that differs per app is `APP_ID` below. Edit the template, not the copies.
 *
 * The problem
 * -----------
 * Every Conduction dev box runs one shared Nextcloud on port 8080 (or 80 when
 * it is published without a port). It bind-mounts the host checkouts under
 * `apps-extra/`, so it serves whatever everybody on the box is editing, and it
 * carries data colleagues are working on. An e2e suite seeds OpenRegister
 * objects and then deletes them again. Pointed at that instance it is not
 * running tests, it is editing someone else's environment. Two apps were
 * caught doing exactly this, by default, because their base URL fell back to
 * `http://localhost:8080` when nothing was set.
 *
 * The rule
 * --------
 * Aiming at a shared instance is allowed. Aiming at one BY ACCIDENT is not.
 * So the target has to be named twice: once as the base URL, and once in an
 * opt-in variable that holds the origin you permit.
 *
 *     E2E_ALLOW_SHARED_INSTANCE=http://localhost:8080 \
 *     PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
 *     npx playwright test
 *
 * The flag holds an ORIGIN, not `1`. A bare `1` left in a shell profile goes
 * on permitting every shared instance the suite ever meets. An origin permits
 * the one you typed and nothing else, so aiming somewhere new makes you type
 * the new one.
 *
 * Two spellings are accepted and they mean the same thing:
 *
 *   E2E_ALLOW_SHARED_INSTANCE              fleet-wide, permits any app's suite
 *   ZAAKAFHANDELAPP_E2E_ALLOW_SHARED_INSTANCE  this app only
 *
 * The app-specific spelling is the safer one to leave in a profile, because it
 * stops at this app. The fleet-wide one is for a session that deliberately
 * drives several suites at one instance.
 *
 * CI is exempt
 * ------------
 * On a GitHub runner `localhost:8080` is the runner's own throwaway Nextcloud,
 * started by the shared ConductionNL/.github workflow and destroyed with the
 * job. Nothing there is shared with anybody. Treating it as shared would break
 * every e2e run in the fleet, so `isCI()` short-circuits the whole rule.
 *
 * This is one of three guards, and they do not overlap
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 *  1. An age bound on the cross-run residue sweep stops one session deleting
 *     another session's LIVE fixtures.
 *  2. A run ledger stops a run's own teardown reaching rows it never created,
 *     at any age. Content matching (`JSON.stringify(row).includes(prefix)`) is
 *     not ownership: it deletes anything that happens to carry the string.
 *  3. This flag stops the cross-run sweep deleting anything at all on a shared
 *     box, because there it cannot tell your leftovers from a colleague's.
 *
 * Guard 3 is the only portable one, which is why it is the one in this
 * template. Guard 2 needs a single create funnel and is written per app.
