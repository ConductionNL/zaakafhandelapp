 * Playwright config for Zaak Afhandel App.
 *
 * Scaffolded under ADR-030 (journeydoc). Zaakafhandelapp previously had
 * no Playwright setup — this is a from-scratch config with two
 * projects:
 *
 *   - `chromium`     — the default regression project. Excludes the
 *                      docs capture spec so PR pipelines don't reshoot
 *                      screenshots on every push. Add regression specs
 *                      under `tests/e2e/` and they run here.
 *   - `docs-capture` — the journeydoc screenshot capture project.
 *                      Opt-in: `npx playwright test --project docs-capture`.
 *                      Output lands in
 *                      `docs/static/screenshots/tutorials/{user,admin}/`.
 *
 * Point at a running Nextcloud with PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL (or BASE_URL, which is
 * what the shared ConductionNL quality workflow exports). There is deliberately
 * NO default — see tests/e2e/base-url.ts. `globalSetup` logs in once
 * (admin/admin by default; override with NC_ADMIN_USER / NC_ADMIN_PASS) and
 * persists the session to `tests/e2e/.auth/admin.json`; every spec reuses it
 * via `use.storageState`.
